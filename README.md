# CS50P: Python Programming - Harvard University

## Overview

This repository contains my solutions to the problem sets and the final project for Harvard University's **CS50P: Introduction to Programming with Python** course. This course focuses exclusively on programming with Python.

## About the Course

**CS50P** is an introduction to programming using Python, designed for students with or without prior programming experience. The curriculum covers:

- Functions, variables, and arguments
- Conditionals and Boolean expressions
- Loops and iterations
- Exception handling
- Writing and running unit tests
- Using third-party libraries
- Working with regular expressions
- Object-oriented programming with classes and objects
- File I/O operations

### Course Structure

The course is divided into ten weeks, each focusing on different aspects of Python programming. It includes hands-on practice with exercises inspired by real-world problems.

## My Experience

I have completed all the assignments and the final project, and received a certificate of completion from Harvard. This repository showcases my journey and solutions for each problem set.

## Repository Contents

- **Problem Sets**: Each problem set is stored in its respective directory, named according to the week it was assigned (e.g., `week1`, `week2`, etc.).
- **Final Project**: The final project is located in the `final_project` directory.
